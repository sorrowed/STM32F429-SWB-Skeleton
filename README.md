# STM32F429-SWB-Skeleton
Skeleton to be used for STM32F429-Discovery board in Systemworkbench

The SystemWorkBench IDE from ST makes embedded development for STM32 devices on Linux a joy. It is free, and the ST-Link V2 debugger is very cheap and included on most discovery boards

This project has two purposes:
1 Test the IDE on Linux and see how mature it is
2 Get more stuff out if the STM32F429 Discovery kit i knicked from my collegue

This project still uses the standard peripheral library
